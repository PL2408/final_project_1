          <p>Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a software development methodology that ensures the
            continuous and automated delivery of software applications to production environments. It involves a series
            of
            practices that enable development teams to build, test, and deploy code changes quickly and efficiently. One
            popular
            tool for
            implementing CI/CD is Jenkins, an open-source automation server that provides a comprehensive set of
            features
            for
            building, testing, and deploying software applications. In this article, we will discuss the construction
            plan
            for
            setting up CI/CD using Jenkins for a project that provides two pipelines for dynamic and static pages.</p>

          <p><strong>The Construction Plan for CI/CD using Jenkins:</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> User creates, adds, and pushes a commit to GitHub</p>
          <p>The first step in the construction plan is for the user to create, add, and push a commit to the project's
            GitHub
            repository. This commit will trigger the Jenkins job, which will initiate the CI/CD pipeline.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> GitHub triggers Jenkins job</p>
          <p>Once the user pushes a commit to the GitHub repository, GitHub triggers the Jenkins job. Jenkins then
            begins
            executing the job on the Jenkins agent.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Jenkins server executes job on agent</p>
          <p>The Jenkins server executes the job on the Jenkins agent, which is a separate server that is responsible
            for
            building, testing, and deploying the software application. The agent executes the job in a separate
            environment,
            which ensures that the job does not interfere with any other processes running on the Jenkins server.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Build image</p>
          <p>The next step in the construction plan is to build the image. The agent pulls the code from the GitHub
            repository
            and builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile. The Docker image is a self-contained unit that contains
            all
            the
            necessary dependencies and configurations required to run the software application.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Agent pushes image to Docker Hub</p>
          <p>After building the Docker image, the agent pushes the image to Docker Hub, which is a public repository for
            storing
            and sharing Docker images. This step ensures that the Docker image is available for deployment to the
            production
            environment.</p>

          <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> The final step in the CI/CD plan is to stop the container in production and start
            the
            container with the
            latest image.<br>
            When the webserver is unavailable, traffic redirects to the static page. The static page is a simplified
            version
            of
            the website that contains basic information about the company, products, and services.</p>
