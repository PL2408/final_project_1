            <h5>Summary</h5>
            <p>In 2022, I changed my profession. Before that,
              I was an ordinary user who didn't even think
              much about how computer worked. But
              under the guidance of a professional mentor,
              I began to study the philosophy of DevOps.
              For me, this is a very exciting and difficult
              profession in which I began to get to know
              the world of the Internet, starting with the
              basic knowledge of Networks and ending
              with self-created CI/CD.
