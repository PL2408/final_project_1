    <h1 class="text-center">My DevOps Journey</h1>
    <p class="lead">In June 2022, I started my DevOps training with the skills of a normal user.</p>
    <p>My friend, Mr. DevOps, offered me to study and we were disappointed. He made a clear plan for me, which included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning about networks as a basis for future learning</li>
      <li>Learning the Linux operating system</li>
      <li>Creating my working repository in Git</li>
      <li>Learning how to use the command line with various shells</li>
      <li>Taking online video courses on AWS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Later, we described the infrastructure that would allow me to create my own site on AWS platform using Terraform. In it, we used Docker and Jenkins for CI/CD. The website runs on Nginx. With the help of CloudFront, we also made a static version of the site.</p>
    <p>I also independently took courses in Git, Linux, Docker, and improved my English level. I would really like to find a job in this new field for me, develop on a real project, and gain new knowledge.</p>
